# Azeroth

A text-based RPG game similar to the Final Fantasy series. Turn based combat, with skills items, and levels.
This is a WIP, I have been developing over my time at school. I have used Java to recreate the basic premise
and will continue to add on more as time goes on.

I was always interested in gaming since a young age, and designing a game has always been on my list of things to do.
RPG's have always had a place in my heart.
